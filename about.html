        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          Most of my professional career is based around finance as years past by it starts to become repetitive 
          that's the reason I made the exciting decision to change careers and join a Coding Boot Camp. I noticed 
          and doing my own research in this sector that your always learning some new technology or coding language 
          and the more years you have in this sector the more of a valuable asset you become to your company and 
          new developers because of the knowledge you have obtain.
